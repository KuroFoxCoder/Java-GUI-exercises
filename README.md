I actually had a bit of trouble with finding a way to grab a value from the JTextField in the first exercise, so I looked into the examples in the lecture. When I saw that you could use parseInt for grabbing a value from the JTextField, however, it went well, until it was time to do the exercise with the JSpinner. I saw a method used in the lecture, getValue() that works only for JSpinners, but I didn't know that I needed to identify the type of value by having, say, (Integer) before the method call.

I also have to admit, I struggled with making the GUIs look good, but I settled for having a functioning GUI. At the very least, it works, and in all honesty, that's all I really wanted.
